# LDCF
The Logarithmicl Dynamic Cuckoo Filter (LDCF) is an efficient approximate membership test data strucutre for dynamic big data sets. LDCF uses a novel multi-level tree structure and reduces the worst insertion and membership testing time from O(N) to O(1), where N is the size of the set. At the same time, LDCF reduces the memory cost of [DCF](https://github.com/CGCL-codes/DCF) as the cardinality of the set increases.

## Environment
We implement DCF with an Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-2430M CPU @2.4GHz and OpenSSL library environment.

Install OpenSSL (Please refer to https://www.openssl.org to learn more).

```txt
sudo apt-get install openssl
sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
```

Build and run the example

```txt
cd src/
make test
./test
```

## Configurations
Configurations including false pisitive, item number can be costomized in "configuration/config.txt".

```txt
false positive = 0.01
item number = 100000000
```
